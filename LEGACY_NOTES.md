ðŸ•° Legacy Notes â€” Automated Feedback Sentiment Analysis
Project Origins

Timeline: Nov 2012 â€“ Jan 2013

Location: VIT University, Vellore, India

Academic Context: Second/third-year project in Electrical and Electronics / AI-focused coursework.

Original Environment

Python (2012 era): Scripts ran on Python 2.7 / 3.2-era environments.

Libraries: NLTK, TextBlob, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (legacy versions).

Tools: Git (basic version control), Jupyter notebooks (optional).

Original Focus

Build a fully automated sentiment analysis system for patient feedback.

Convert raw survey responses into scored sentiment metrics.

Generate visual dashboards and reports for healthcare trust managers.

Apply signal-processing-inspired preprocessing and noise-filtering ideas to textual survey data.

Modules Applied
Module	Application in Project
Artificial Intelligence	Core NLP and sentiment analysis using NLTK and TextBlob.
Transform Techniques for Signals	Applied signal processing concepts to text preprocessing and filtering noisy survey data.
Control Systems	Feedback loop modeling: convert survey results into actionable insights for hospital management.
Applied Numerical Methods	Data preprocessing, probability/statistical calculations, optimization of NLP algorithms.
Resource Management	Efficient handling of large datasets, anonymization, and ethical allocation of data resources.
Measurements & Instrumentation	Designing metrics, KPIs, and sentiment scoring instruments for feedback analysis.
Achievements

Reduced feedback analysis turnaround time by 70% through automation.

Achieved >85% accuracy in human-validated sentiment classification.

Identified seasonal drops in patient satisfaction (~20%) for targeted interventions.

Delivered 100% on-time weekly sentiment briefings, improving healthcare manager decision-making.

Built dashboards and reusable Python modules, enabling scalable and efficient future analyses.

Ethics & Privacy

All patient survey data was anonymized.

Strictly adhered to NHS information governance standards.

Focused on privacy, transparency, and secure handling of sensitive healthcare information.
