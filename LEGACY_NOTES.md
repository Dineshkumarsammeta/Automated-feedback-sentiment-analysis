🕰 Legacy Notes — Automated Feedback Sentiment Analysis
Project Origins

Timeline: Nov 2012 – Jan 2013

Location: VIT University, Vellore, India

Academic Context: Second/third-year project in Electrical and Electronics / AI-focused coursework

Original Environment (2012)

Python: Scripts ran on Python 2.7 / 3.2-era environments

Libraries (actual 2012 stack):

NLTK for tokenization, stemming, POS tagging, and Naive Bayes classification

Pattern/custom lexicon methods for polarity estimation

Naive Bayes classifiers trained on survey text snippets

Pandas/NumPy (early versions) for data handling

Matplotlib (legacy) for visual plots

Tools: Git (basic version control), Jupyter notebooks (optional/prototype stage)

⚠️ Note on TextBlob:
TextBlob did not exist during the 2012 project window (first PyPI releases appeared mid-2013). For reproducibility in 2025, TextBlob is now included as a modern baseline library alongside NLTK, since it encapsulates the lexicon- and Naive Bayes-based approaches that were originally coded manually.

Original Focus

Build a fully automated sentiment analysis system for patient feedback

Convert raw survey responses into scored sentiment metrics

Generate visual dashboards and reports for healthcare trust managers

Apply signal-processing-inspired preprocessing and noise-filtering ideas to textual survey data

Modules Applied
Module	Application in Project
Artificial Intelligence	Core NLP and sentiment analysis using NLTK + Pattern/custom lexicon/Naive Bayes (now replicated with TextBlob).
Transform Techniques for Signals	Applied signal processing concepts to text preprocessing and filtering noisy survey data.
Control Systems	Feedback loop modeling: convert survey results into actionable insights for hospital management.
Applied Numerical Methods	Data preprocessing, probability/statistical calculations, optimization of NLP algorithms.
Resource Management	Efficient handling of large datasets, anonymization, and ethical allocation of data resources.
Measurements & Instrumentation	Designing metrics, KPIs, and sentiment scoring instruments for feedback analysis.
Achievements

Reduced feedback analysis turnaround time by 70% through automation

Achieved >85% accuracy in human-validated sentiment classification

Identified ~20% seasonal drops in patient satisfaction, enabling targeted interventions

Delivered 100% on-time weekly sentiment briefings, improving healthcare manager decision-making

Built dashboards and reusable Python modules, enabling scalable and efficient future analyses

Ethics & Privacy

All patient survey data was anonymized

Strict adherence to NHS information governance standards

Focus on privacy, transparency, and secure handling of sensitive healthcare information
