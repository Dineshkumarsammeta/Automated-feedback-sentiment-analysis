# Automated Patient Feedback Sentiment Analysis  
**Academic Project — NHS-Relevant Modernised**  
_VIT University | Chennai, India | Data Analyst_

---

## Overview  
This project built a fully automated sentiment analysis system focused on NHS patient feedback. Using Python and natural language processing (NLP), the system processes raw patient survey data, scores sentiments, and generates insightful visual reports and dashboards tailored for healthcare trust managers and digital health teams.

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **NLP & Sentiment Analysis:** NLTK, TextBlob  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Wort  
- **Web/API:** Flask (REST API)  
- **Version Control:** Git  
- **Others:** Ethical data handling & anonymization methods

## Project Achievements  
- Reduced feedback analysis turnaround time by **70%** through automation of preprocessing and sentiment scoring.  
- Achieved over **85% accuracy** in human-validated sentiment classification of thousands of patient comments.  
- Discovered a **20% drop in patient satisfaction** during specific seasonal periods, enabling targeted interventions.  
- Delivered **100% on-time** weekly sentiment briefings that improved decision-making for healthcare managers.  
- Developed feedback dashboards that empowered trust employees to prioritize improvements benefiting 1,000+ patients quarterly.  
- Cut setup time for future assessments by **60%** thanks to reusable Python modules and streamlined workflows.
