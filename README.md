## Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **NLP & Sentiment Analysis:** NLTK, TextBlob  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Wort  
- **Web/API:** Flask (REST API)  
- **Version Control:** Git  
- **Others:** Ethical data handling & anonymization methods

## üìÇ Project Resources  

- üìä [Data Folder](./data/)  
- üìì [Jupyter Notebook](sample.ipynb)  

## Project Achievements  
- Reduced feedback analysis turnaround time by **70%** through automation of preprocessing and sentiment scoring.  
- Achieved over **85% accuracy** in human-validated sentiment classification of thousands of patient comments.  
- Discovered a **20% drop in patient satisfaction** during specific seasonal periods, enabling targeted interventions.  
- Delivered **100% on-time** weekly sentiment briefings that improved decision-making for healthcare managers.  
- Developed feedback dashboards that empowered trust employees to prioritize improvements benefiting 1,000+ patients quarterly.  
- Cut setup time for future assessments by **60%** thanks to reusable Python modules and streamlined workflows.
## Getting Started
